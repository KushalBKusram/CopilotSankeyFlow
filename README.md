## Features

- **Interactive Sankey Diagram**: Visualize income flow to savings and expense categories
- **Multiple Date Ranges**: View transactions for different time periods (Last Week, Month, 60/90 days, 6 months, Year, All Time)
- **Key Metrics Dashboard**: Track Income, Expenses, Savings, and Savings Rate
- **Category Drill-Down**: Click on any category to see:
  - Top 10 merchants/payees in that category (pie chart)
  - Detailed transaction table
  - Category-specific metrics
- **Percentage-Based Labels**: Node labels show percentages of income for easy comparison
- **Automatic Refund Handling**: Negative amounts are properly handled as refunds that reduce expenses
- **CSV File Upload**: Direct upload of Copilot Money export files - no manual file placement needed

## Demo

The app displays:
- **Income** flows into **Savings** and various **Expense Categories**
- Each category shows its percentage of total income
- Interactive category selection for detailed merchant breakdowns
- Real-time metrics update based on selected date range

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KushalBKusram/CopilotSankeyFlow.git
cd CopilotSankeyFlow
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

3. Upload your **Copilot Money** export CSV file using the file uploader in the sidebar

That's it! The app will automatically process your Copilot Money transactions and visualize them.

## Customization

### Date Range Presets
Modify the date range options in [app.py](app.py):
```python
date_range_option = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Date Range",
    ["All Time", "Last Week", "Last Month", ...],
    index=2  # Default selection
)
```

### Category Colors
The Sankey diagram automatically generates colors for categories, but you can customize them in the code by modifying the color generation logic.

### Filters
The app currently filters:
- By date range (user selectable)
- Excludes transactions with empty categories (for expenses)
- Handles income vs expense separation based on transaction type

## Features Explained

### Income Calculation
- Only transactions with `type == 'income'` are counted as income
- Uses absolute value of amount (since income is stored as negative)

### Expense Calculation
- All non-income transactions with valid categories
- Sum includes negative amounts (refunds) which reduce category totals
- Excluded transactions are filtered out

### Savings Calculation
```
Savings = Total Income - Total Expenses
Savings Rate = (Savings / Income) × 100%
```

### Category Drill-Down
When you select a category:
1. **Pie Chart**: Shows top 10 merchants/payees by spending
2. **Transaction Table**: Lists up to 20 recent transactions in that category
3. **Metrics**: Total spent, transaction count, average transaction size
